# Contribute

First of all, we thank you for your interest in our project and any contributions you can make.

## Before you start

`buzzard` is under active development. bugs, enhancements and new features suggestions are warm welcome. See [`TODO`](https://www.notion.so/buzzard/2c94ef6ee8da4d6280834129cc00f4d2?v=334ead18796342feb32ba85ccdfcf69f) for a glimpse to our actual pipeline.

If you have discovered a new bug, please search for existing issues, open and closed, before creating a new one. You can track new ones creating a Github [issue](https://github.com/earthcube-lab/buzzard/issues). `buzzard` execution environments can be quite complex. Please describe it as much as possible. Reproduction steps and dataset are more than useful!
